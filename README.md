# [Description Pokédex](https://widroz.github.io/DescriptionPokedex/)

This React app allows user to search a Pokémon and read its entry in a specific game.

![Example](https://github.com/widroz/DescriptionPokedex/blob/master/public/use%20example.gif)

Descriptions and official artwork are fetched from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and they are available in English for every "Main" Pokémon Game.
Descriptions in Italian, Korean, Japanese, German, Spanish and French are also available in API for versions X and Y, so they are included.

(Currently working on future modes: stats, growth type, moves, specific game sprites...)
